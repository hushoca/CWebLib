# C Web Library
This is my implementation of a web parsing library for better understanding networking and how to use sockets in C. This library will be a general use library with ability to parse HTML. My main aim is to complete and use this library with an ESP8266 and make a device which allows user to browse internet like a browser.

# Disclaimer
- This is a work in progress project, I am not aiming for efficiency I am just aiming for functionality since this project is all about giving me better understanding of networking and sockets.

# PROGRESS: NOT EVEN CLOSE TO DONE.
