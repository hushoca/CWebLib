# C Web Library
This is my implementation of a web parsing library for better understanding networking and how to use sockets in C. This library will be a general use library with ability to parse HTML. My main aim was to complete and use this library with an ESP8266 and make a device which allows user to browse internet like a browser.

# Disclaimer
- This project won't be completed. I'll rewrite it from scratch in C++ so I can have a HTML tag in class and can use namespaces...
